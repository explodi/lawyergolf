# Lawyer Golf

You are meeting fellow lawyer Pheldon for a game of golf. Or actually, mini. golf. You can feel the tension in the air cutting through your skin like acid rain. Will it be thick enough to play without everything turning sideways?

A game developed for the Ludum Dare #32 game jam. The theme was "An unconventional weapon"
